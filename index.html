      <h3>About Me</h3>

        <!-- Personal background information -->
        My name is Gleb Vlasov, I'm 21 years old. I was born in Russia
        and moved to the United States with my family over 5 years ago.
        We moved to a town called wayland which is located in the middle between Boston and Worcester
        because we had a family member in that area. As I was growing up I saw rapid evolution of internet
        and technology which defined a technical mindset of a generation and gave me excitement to
        pursue Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        <!-- Academic background -->
        I'm a third year student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where I'm studying Computer Science.
        In my first two years I have learned a lot of fundamentals and reinforced programming experience
        from my school days. Now, in my third year I finally started diving deeper into development
        of applications, corporate pipelines and more tangible full-stack projects.
        I continue to learn new tools via my courses such as Software, Webware, AI and ML
        engineering. Full stack web development and AI engineering are especially exciting
        as both of those areas are notably creative and require brainstorming and problem-solving on a bigger picture
        which I particularly enjoy.

            A LOT <br /> I have used html since middle school for fun and personal projects.
            While I might not be up to date or missing some situational knowledge,
            I'm confident in my skills and ability to write HTML code.

            SOME <br /> While I used JavaScript for personal projects and classes a lot,
            I do not yet feel fully comfortable with it. With the assistance of the internet
            I can get a lot accomplished, but may struggle by myself. I have also attempted to use
            TypeScript out of curiosity, and it did not feel like a tough transition, but I do lack experience with it.

          <td>SQL</td>
          <td>
            SOME <br /> While I only took Databases I class, I used MySQL and Oracle as a part of a few
            other classes and personal projects. While my experience might still be limited,
            I feel comfortable with SQL and ready to adopt new systems and infrastructures that use it.

          <td>
            SOME <br /> I have used ReactJS/Next.js during other classes.
            I understand the general idea and how to write code, but I critically lack experience using them.
            I am currently exploring React and Next in depth using online resources.

            blackbox testing, including Unit testing as well.
