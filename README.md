This project implements a personal webpage with information about me and my hobby. The site consists of two pages with responsive design, custom styling, and simple animation of articles.

## Technical Achievements
- **CSS Variables**: Implemented color theming with CSS variables
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Added automatic theme switching based on system preferences
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with adaptive styling
- **JavaScript Animation**: Added simple fade-in animations for content sections

### Design Achievements
- **Google Fonts**: Used Lexend font for typography
- **Color Palette**: Created a color scheme with light/dark variants
    Screenshot of color palette is DMColors.png. It's a custom palette I created for dark mode systems. Light mode is similar with colors swapped and shifted a bit in hue. It was however
    primarily designed for dark mode systems, so if possible, use dark mode for best experience.
- **Custom Form Elements**: Styled form inputs with hover and focus states
- **Smooth Transitions**: Added subtle animations for interactive elements (button, articles)
